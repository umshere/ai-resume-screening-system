_Smart Progress Tracking & Bug Fixes_

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Dynamic Progress Calculation

- **Fixed hardcoded max_interactions** - Now dynamically calculated based on agent count
- **Improved progress tracking** - Shows "Round X/Y" instead of confusing "Step X/10"
- **Agent-aware progress display** - Shows current agent and total agent count in status
- **Optimized interaction cycles** - Prevents unnecessary extended processing

### Variable Scope Fixes

- **Fixed "name 'resumes' is not defined" error** in `display_screening_results` function
- **Corrected variable scope** by using `resumes_to_screen` instead of undefined `resumes`
- **Enhanced error handling** with proper variable references throughout the application

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Smart Agent Orchestration

- **Dynamic max_interactions calculation**: `max(num_agents * 2, 4)` ensures optimal rounds
- **Progress calculation logic**: Each agent gets at least 2 rounds, minimum 4 total
- **Better user feedback**: Clear indication of which agent is working and progress status

### Example Enhanced Progress Display

```
Main Status:
Round 2/4 | Experience_Evaluation_Agent | 2 agents total | Initial Analysis
üéØ Evaluating work experience relevance for 3 candidate(s)

Sidebar Agent Card:
üë§ Skills_Analysis_Agent
üîß Technical Skills & Expertise
üîç Cross-referencing skill requirements with candidate experience

Previous Simple Format:
For 2 agents: "Round 1/4: Skills_Analysis_Agent is analyzing... (2 agents total)"
```
